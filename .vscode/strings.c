// =============================================
// A character array is a data structure in C that stores a sequence of characters. It is commonly used to represent strings. In C, strings are null-terminated, meaning that the last character in the array is followed by a special null character ('\0') to indicate the end of the string.

// for example, the string "Hello" can be represented as a character array as follows:
// char str[6] = "Hello"; // 5 characters + 1 null terminator

// The size of the array must be large enough to accommodate all characters in the string, including the null terminator.

// If the size is not specified, the compiler will automatically allocate enough space for the string and the null terminator.
