// Pointers
// ======================

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Pointers are variables that store the address of another variable. They are used to manipulate data in memory directly and can be used to create dynamic data structures like linked lists, trees, etc.
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// * 1. Pointers are variables that store memory addresses of other variables.
// * 2. They are declared using the asterisk (*) symbol before the variable name.
// * 3. Pointers can be dereferenced using the asterisk (*) operator to access the value at the address they point to.
// * 4. The address of a variable can be obtained using the ampersand (&) operator.
// * 5. Pointers can be used to create dynamic data structures like linked lists, trees, etc.
// * 6. Pointers can be passed to functions to modify the original variable's value.
// * 7. Pointers can be used to allocate and deallocate memory dynamically using malloc() and free() functions.
// * 8. Pointers can be used to create arrays of pointers, pointer to pointers, and function pointers.
// * 9. Pointers can be used to create multi-dimensional arrays and strings.
// * 10. Pointers can be used to create and manipulate complex data types like structures and unions.
// * 11. Pointers can be used to create and manipulate arrays of structures and structures of pointers.
// * 12. Pointers can be used to create and manipulate arrays of arrays and arrays of pointers to functions.
// * 13. Pointers can be used to create and manipulate arrays of pointers to structures and structures of pointers to arrays.
// * 14. Pointers can be used to create and manipulate arrays of pointers to functions and functions of pointers to arrays.
// * 15. Pointers can be used to create and manipulate arrays of pointers to pointers and pointers to pointers to arrays.
